About the Project

This project was developed as part of an Alura course, with the goal of improving and evolving a previous project. It serves as a practical challenge to reinforce concepts learned in Object-Oriented Programming using Java.

The project simulates a media platform where users can interact with different types of content, such as movies, series, episodes, music, and podcasts. It includes features like ratings, play count tracking, and a simple recommendation system.
